Project Base

- We can generate a new app from this base by CLI: bash gen-new-app.sh packageName appName
 + example of packageName: com.vnd.alobridge
 + example of appName: ScretApp
 
- Requirement: bash's version > 4.0
- After run bash, gen-new-app.sh and .git will be deleted! And we must reopen project with new name is appName.
